# Exam_Evaluator
This is a simple Exam Evaluator i made using cosine of similarity and Bert model available on Hugging face.
Using transformer library on hugging Face i used there model.i have already added an option of uploading pdf document.
What this evaluator does is that it takes pdf which user upload. Then the question is typed with respect to the pdf uploaded and atlast answer of student.
What it actually does is that pdf uploaded data is read converted into textual data and is used as context to detect whether answer is correct or not.
This can easily be live on gradio as i have already done.
